# The Two-Board Problem

Two-board problem repo consists of 2 files: 

- two_board.md - the definition of the problem with the explanation of difficulty and limits imposed on the agents for polynomial case of Two-Board. 
- two_board_environment.py - MDP environment of the two-board. 

The Two-Board Problem formalizes creative problem-solving and research tasks. 

It captures the core property which makes those particularly challenging: information asymmetry between theoretical work, and its validation against the environment.

Designing the solution requires inventing new primitives, the reward landscape is sparse, and no gradient signal exists until the correct construction is found.
